            Hi, I’m <strong></strong>Pasquale Salomone</strong>—a Data Scientist with a passion for solving real problems through smart, efficient use of technology. I’m driven by curiosity, creativity, and a love for learning, whether it’s mastering the latest in AI or just figuring out how a few lines of regex can save hours of work 😎.
My journey into data science started back in 2013 while working as a contractor for the U.S. Army in Germany. Before that, I served as an officer in the Italian Air Force, an experience that shaped my approach to strategy, discipline, and teamwork.
With over 10 years in the field, I focus on turning data into actionable insights that align with business goals. I enjoy bridging the gap between complex analytics and practical outcomes—especially when it comes to exploring how neural networks and large language models are changing the game.
Above all, I believe learning never stops. It’s not just something I do—it’s who I am. Staying curious and adaptable helps me grow as a professional and keeps me at the cutting edge of AI and data science.</div>
