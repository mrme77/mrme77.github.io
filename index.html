          <p>
            Ciao! I’m <strong>Pasquale Salomone</strong> — a Data Scientist with a passion for solving real problems through smart, efficient use of technology. I’m driven by curiosity, creativity, and a love for learning, whether it’s mastering the latest in AI or just figuring out how a few lines of regex can save hours of work 😎.
          </p>
          <p>
            My journey into data science started back in 2013 while working as a contractor for the U.S. Army in Germany. Before that, I served as an officer in the Italian Air Force, an experience that shaped my approach to strategy, discipline, and teamwork.
          </p>
          <p>
            With over 10 years in the field, I focus on turning data into actionable insights that align with business goals. I enjoy bridging the gap between complex analytics and practical outcomes—especially when it comes to exploring how neural networks and large language models are changing the game.
          </p>
          <p>
            Above all, I believe learning never stops. It’s not just something I do—it’s who I am. Staying curious and adaptable helps me grow as a professional and keeps me at the cutting edge of AI and data science.

<p>
  When I have a bit of breathing room, I like to build things — sometimes to learn something new, other times to revisit old ideas with fresh eyes. Lately, I’ve been digging into tools like Google Vertex AI and Hugging Face to get a deeper feel for what they can actually do in real-world scenarios.
</p>
<p>
  One project I’ve been thinking about is training a neural network to predict presidential executive orders—part historical deep dive, part machine learning challenge. I'm also experimenting with running a local LLM at home through the Ollama interface, mostly to cut out token limits and fees, but also because I like having full control and privacy.
These kinds of projects keep me sharp, curious, and connected to the fast-moving world of AI and Data Science.

  Here are some of my recent projects that showcase my skills and interests in data science and AI:
